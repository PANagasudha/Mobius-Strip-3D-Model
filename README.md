# Mobius-Strip-3D-Model
A Mobius strip is a non-orientable surface with only one side and one continuous boundary. It is formed by taking a rectangular strip of paper, twisting one end by 180 degrees, and then joining it to the other end.

A MÃ¶bius strip is a surface with:
Only one side
Only one boundary
A famous example of a non-orientable surface in mathematics and topology

It can be formed by:
Taking a strip of paper,
Giving it a half-twist, and
Joining the ends together.


ðŸ“Œ Parametric Equations Used
Let R be the radius, w the width, and (u, v) be the parameters.
x(u, v) = (R + vÂ·cos(u/2))Â·cos(u)
y(u, v) = (R + vÂ·cos(u/2))Â·sin(u)
z(u, v) = vÂ·sin(u/2)


Parameter Ranges/Domain:
u âˆˆ [0, 2Ï€]: Encircles the strip
v âˆˆ [âˆ’w/2, w/2]: Across the width


Working (Step-by-Step)
1. Initialization
The MÃ¶bius strip is defined using a central radius (R), width (w), and a resolution (n) for accuracy.
Parameters u and v are created to define points around the strip and across its width.

2. Mesh Generation
A grid of points (u, v) is created using NumPy.
For each point, corresponding 3D coordinates (X, Y, Z) are calculated to form the MÃ¶bius surface.
These points represent the twisted surface of the strip.

3. Surface Area Calculation
The rate of change of points is calculated along both directions (u and v) using gradients.
The interaction between these rates (via cross product) gives the size of small surface patches.
All patches are added up to estimate the total surface area of the strip.

4. Edge Length Calculation
The MÃ¶bius strip has two boundary curves (edges).
The distances between consecutive points along each edge are calculated.
Both edge lengths are summed to get the total boundary length.

5. Visualization
A 3D plot of the MÃ¶bius strip is generated using Matplotlib.
The strip is rendered with a color gradient to enhance visibility and shape.
